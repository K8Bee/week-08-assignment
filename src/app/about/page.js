      <h2>About</h2>
      <h4>
        Welcome! This blog focusses on the Three Pines book series by Louise
        Penny. It&apos;s a place to share your thoughts on any of the books, get
        to know them a little better and maybe discover something you
        didn&apos;t catch on the first, second, or even third read. Take a seat
        and imagine yourself in the Bistro at Three Pines, something delicious
        on your plate, and quite possibly an elderly woman with her duck by your
        side ready to swipe your drink.
