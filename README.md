<!-- # Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

## Required

-- What requirements did you achieve?
- Display all posts(comments?) on the page, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order.
- Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
Please submit your database schema, as is mentioned in the submission instructions.

-- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
- Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.
- Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
- Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. /posts/:postid).
- Add a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.

-- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
- ran out of time
